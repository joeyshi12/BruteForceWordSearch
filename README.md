# gen-rec-word-search
<body>
This project is a demonstration of the problem-solving power of generative recursion. A word_search function is provided in src/main/ui/Main.py and works as follows: <br/>
Given a list of characters and length n, the function generates and searches through an arity tree of depth n consisting of possible combinations of characters (avoiding redundency by ignoring repeated combinations).
