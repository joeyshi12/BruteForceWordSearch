# gen-rec-word-search

This project is a demonstration of the problem-solving power of generative recursion. Given a list of characters and 
length n, the function generates and searches through an arity tree of depth n consisting of possible combinations of 
characters (avoiding redundancy by ignoring repeated combinations).
