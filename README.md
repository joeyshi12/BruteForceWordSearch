# gen-rec-word-search
This project is a demonstration of the problem-solving power of generative recursion. Given a list of characters and 
length n, the function generates and searches through an arity tree of depth n consisting of possible combinations of 
characters (avoiding redundency by ignoring repeated combinations). 

## Getting Started

Run the project from shell
```shell script
python main.py
```
