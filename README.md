# gen-rec-word-search
This project is a demonstration of the problem-solving power of generative recursion. A word_search function is provided and works as follows: </br>
Given a list of characters and length n, the function generates and searches through an arity tree of depth n consisting of possible combinations of characters (avoiding redundency by ignoring repeated combinations). 

## Getting Started

Run src/main/ui/Main.py to test out the word_search function.

## Example
```python
search_words(['w', 'o', 'r', 'd'], 2)
```

## Running the tests

Python UnitTests are provided for the functions in the WordSearch python file. These tests can be found and run at src/test/WordSearchTest.py.
